I have experience with both Backend and Frontend Development. Recently, I have gained some experience in DevOps tools like Ansible and Kubernetes.

👑 My favorite project is [**FACTs**](https://github.com/Sumedh-Patkar/BenchmarkingDiffTool), a project that I built at **Marvell Semiconductor** with the Application benchmarking team. The documentation is being updated.  
💡 The project that had the most unknowns/challenges - ***Bucky*** - A voice controlled semi-autonomous object delivery robot 🛻. I built it in my junior year along with my project teammates at **Espressif Systems**. Here's the code [link](https://github.com/Ronit-j/Bucky) and [some documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F9a7XMYrP_Ipbk7eHiBAKLD-HhrGJjSO3n7lAkVn6Kw/edit?usp=sharing)

🔭 I am currently looking for a Full time role in Software Engineering.

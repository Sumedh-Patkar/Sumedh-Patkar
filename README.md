I have experience with both Backend and Frontend Development. Recently, I have gained some experience in DevOps tools like Ansible and Kubernetes.

ðŸ‘‘ My favorite project is FACTs [link](https://github.com/Sumedh-Patkar/BenchmarkingDiffTool), a project that I built at Marvell Semiconductor with the Application benchmarking team. The documentation is being updated.
ðŸ’¡ The project that had the most unknowns/challenges - Bucky - A voice controlled semi-autonomous object delivery robot ðŸ›». I built it in my junior year along with my project teammates at Espressif Systems. Here's the code [link](https://github.com/Ronit-j/Bucky) and [some documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F9a7XMYrP_Ipbk7eHiBAKLD-HhrGJjSO3n7lAkVn6Kw/edit?usp=sharing)

I am currently looking for a Full time role in Software Engineering.
